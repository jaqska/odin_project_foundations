    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg potatoes</li>
      <li>2 pieces of egg yolk</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of shredded parmesan</li>
      <li>150g of fine pasta flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoons of pepper</li>
      <li>0.25 teaspoons of muscat</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make gnocchi</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Peal the potatoes and boil them in unsalted water. Pour off the water
        and put the pot back on the heater. Let the water evaporate from the
        bottom of the pot. Let the potatoes cool on the bench until they have
        cooled a bit.
      </li>
      <li>Shred the potatoes such that they have a fine consistency.</li>
      <li>
        Make a hole in the middle of the potato pile. Put egg yolk and shredded
        parmesan in the hole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, salt, pepper and muscat, and add it to the egg yolk and
        parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mit it all together with your hands. The dough will be quite loose at
        the start. Add some flour until the dough has a firm and flexible
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the dough into smaller pieces which you flatten out. Cut the dough
        into smaller pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a fork and press it down onto the small pieces of dough to get a
        nice gnocchi pattern. Add some flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil water in a big pot. Add salt and boil the gnocchi until they float
        on top of the water. Now the gnocchi are finished boiling. Don't boil
        too many gnocchi at once. Collect the gnocchi and pour some olive oil on
        top of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
